The EZStruder by SeeMeCNC is the answer to all the issues with the original Steve's Extruder.  More compact, lightweight, and EZ to use!
It is a direct drive, highly adaptable extruder for use with any of the popular groove-mount style hotends, as well as 1.75mm bowden extruders.  When purchased from SeeMeCNC.com it comes 
with the bowden adapter to use a PTC fitting for use with 4mm OD teflon tubing.  Otherwise, you can mount any groove-mount hotend directly to it.
